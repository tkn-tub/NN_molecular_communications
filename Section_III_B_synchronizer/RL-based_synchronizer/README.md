# RL-based_synchronizer

This directory contains the MATLAB and Simulink code to train and evaluate the RL-based synchronizer.

The agent used for the evaluation is available in ```Agents/rcv_pretrained.mat```.

To train a new agent run ```train_agent_single_run.m```.

To evaluate an agent run ```eval_agent.m```.
