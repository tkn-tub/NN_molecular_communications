# NN architectures with Microfluidic Circuits
This project develops microfluidic circuits in COMSOL to model their computational capabilities.

## Description
This project is a work in progress to explore the computational capabilites with microfluidic circuits.
We aim to implement the linear and non-linear components of a neuron by connecting various microfluidic pipes.
As illustrated in Fig. 1, the linear component of the neuron as

 lies on the mobility component of the microfluidic circuit, while the nonlinear component is realized with a chemical reaction.

The implemented microfluidic in COMSOL is illustrated in Fig. 2.
The microfluidic consists of single pipe with a turn for a larger variability of the channel.
The straight and turning paths account for the linear component in Eq. (1) and is developed within the first three compartments.
The chemical reaction is developed in the last compartment of the pipe.

The flow within the pipe is defined with water H2O as the material, the water fluid is forced to keep a velocity $v_0$ at the inlet.
The pipe comprises two inlets, one within the first compartment and a second one on the top wall of the last compartment.
In the Inlet 1, the chemical input component is Acetic Acid (CH3COOH), in the Inlet 2 is Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH), both reactants produce Sodium Acetic (CH3COONa) and water.
This particular reaction was selected due to its affordability in chemical labs and due to the variability of the product pH with the concentration of CH2COONa.
This particular reaction is an acid-base one, where the pH level develops an S-function with the concentration of the product.
As such it develops the needed non-linear component of the neuron scheme.

This simulation also includes a time variable concentration at the Inlet 1.
The Acetic Acid is feeded in a form of pulse with the concentration level.
This allows to model pulse-based transmissions within the microfluidic channel.

## Installation
This simulation is developed in COMSOL Multiphysics 6.3.
The phisics included within this simulation are the following:

- Chemical Species of Transport: Reaction Engineering, Chemical Reaction, and Transport of Diluted Species.
- Fluid Flow: Single-Phase Flow.

## Usage

This project directly runs from the file `2D_turn_chemÄ±ical_reaction.mph`, which is located in the folder `COMSOL_2D_turn_chemical_reaction`.
Besides, we also provide Matlab code in the file `Master_File.mlx` to plot the exported results from COMSOL.
This project can be customized with their parameters, which are defined within the box `Global Definition/Paremeters 1`.
Parameters are related to the geometry of the pipe, the chemical reaction, and the fluid of the chemical components.
The main parameters related to this simulation are described as follows 

### Chemical reaction parameters

| ------------- | ------------- |
| A | Forward frequency factor accounting for the Arrhenius expression.|
| c_CH3COOH_ini  | Initial concentration of Acetic acid. |
| c_NaOH_ini  | Initial concentration of Sodium hydroxide. |
| c_CH3COONa_ini  | Initial concentration of Acetic Sodium. |
| c_H2O_ini  | Initial concentration of water. |

### Geometry parameters
The most relevant parameters related to the geometry are the size of the three straigth paths, the turning angle, and the radius of the pipe.
These parameters are listed as follows

| Geometry-related parameters  | Description |

### Transport related parameters

The fluid within the pipe follows the initial speed of the Inlet 1, and we also define a second speed to release the components whithin the Inlet 2.
We also introduce the diffusion coefficients for each component in water.
These parameters are

Within the Inlet 1, we introduce a time variable concentration level of the Acetic Acid which is controled with the paremeters

| Pulse-related Parameters  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|pulse_duration| Pulse duration of the concentration at the Inlet 1.|
|pulse_transition|Pulse transition of the concentration at the Inlet 1.|

### Geometry

The main geometry is defined in Component 1, which is an space-dependent simulation.
The geometry consist of four components: 1) `pipe_in_1`, where the left inlet is located for the CH3COO chemical reactant; 2) Circular_Arc which defines the turning; 3) the pipe_out as rectangle that continues the turning, and 4) the `Chemical_Chamber` where a second inlet is located for the reactant NaOH.

### Definitions in Component 1
For the easiest of the physics configuration, various selections are defined in regard to the domain, the walls, the two inlets and the outlet.
These geometry selections are defined in `Model Builder/Component 1/Definitions/Selections`.
Besides, a rectangular function is defined to model the inlet for the CH3COO chemical component.
This rectangular function is defined `Analytic 1 (pulse)` of parameter `t`, which uses the `Rectangle 1 (rect 1)` function.
The `rect 1` function defines a rectangular pulse of pulse duration and transition given by the parameters `pulse_duration` and `pulse_transition`.

### Physics and simulation results

The simulation includes the modeling of the chemical reaction, the laminar flow and the transport of diluted species within the pipe.
A variety of studies are included to accounts for these components.
Besides, we plot the simulation results in Matlab with the file `Master_File.mlx`.
The matlab code imports results from COMSOL, which is stored in the file `datasets`.

The reaction is the non-reversible basic-acid: CH3COOH+NaOH -> CH3COONa+H2O.
This time-dependent study produces a Global 1D plot to evaluate the concentration of reactants and products with time.
This is illustrated within the `Model Builder/Results`  in COMSOL for the entry `Chemical Reaction`.
The results are exported into the file `chemical_reaction.csv` and illustrated in Fig. 2 below.

Initial values are zero for the speed and the pressure.
Two inlets are defined for the two reactants of normal inflow velocities defined by the paramters `v0` and `v0_chem_inlet`.

- Inflow 1: This inlet is the one located on the left of the pipe. It inflows the chemical CH3COOH as a pulse using the entry `c_CH3COOH_ini*pulse(t)`.
The value for `c_CH3COOH_ini` is defined in the `Global Definitions/Parameters`.
The function of time `pulse(t)` is defined in `Component 1/Definitions/Analytic 1`.
- Inflow 2: Located at the inlet of the chemical chamber domain, it defines the feeding of the chemical component NaOH.
This chemical is constant with time, which is defined with concentration level `c_NaOH_init`.
