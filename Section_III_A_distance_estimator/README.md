# Distance Estimator
This project develops a neural network (NN) module for detecting the distance among cells.

## Description
This project develops a NN module to estimate the distance among cells. The project features the application where the distance to a tumor cell is estimated based on the vesicles-amount observed at the immune cell. Cancer and immune cells exchange vesicles in
the proximity of each others, and the concentration level of vesicles can be used to estimate distance as it is a distance dependent process.
