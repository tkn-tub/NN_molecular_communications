# Distance Estimator
This project develops a neural network (NN) module for detecting the distance among cells.

## Description
This project develops a NN module to estimate the distance among cells. The project features the application where the distance to a tumor cell is estimated based on the vesicles-amount observed at the immune cell; see Fig. 1 below. Cancer and immune cells exchange vesicles in the proximity of each others, and the concentration level of vesicles can be used to estimate distance as it is a distance dependent process.
